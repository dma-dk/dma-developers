Cloudbees
==============
We use Cloudbees for two things:
1. As a continuous integration server, constantly verifying checkins and running tests
2. For storing maven artifacts


Adding a new project to Cloudbees
===============
The easiest way to add a new maven based project to cloudbees is to clone an existing project.
